# List of unavailable tools
These tools will not be hosted on the server. They exist in the BBLab-Wiki backup (MDF) but have not been ported to Python 3/Django. They are all under source control from deleted repos, dating from 2014-2017.
- __HAPC__ - HLA Associated Polymorphism Counter HAPC
- __HAPA__ - HLA Associated Polymorphism Analyzer HAPA
- __PHAGE-I__ - Proportion of HLA Associated Genomic Escape (individual) 
- __PHAGE-P__ - Proportion of HLA Associated Genomic Escape (population) PHAGE-P
- __HAPLOID__ - HLA Associated PoLymOrphism IDentifier HAPLOID
- __CLEF__ - CTL Epitope Finder CLEF

# Misc To-Do

- Update Django from 2.2.0 to 2.2.26
- (Longer term) Migrate to a newer Django as 2.2 is losing support in April 2022.

# Further Notes

Further explanation for some specific tools as needed.

# Blind Dating
- An earlier version of __Phylogenetic Dating__
- This is not linked on the BBLab wiki page, however it is stored on the server. There is a `tools/blind_dating/repo` directory which is tracking the `web` branch of [`cfe-lab/blind-dating`], though it is 7 commits behind. 
- There is another Git repo in the `tools/blind_dating` directory that is tracking a non-existent repository called `cfe-lab/web_blind_dating.git`. This one is integrated with Django and contains a Python script `blind_dating.py` which calls the R scripts located in `repo/src`.
    - (Note: the R scripts `root_and_regress.R` and `plot_divergence_vs_time.R` are also located in `tools/phylodating`, which is tracking [`cfe-lab/phylodating`].)

# PHAGE-I-expanded
The source control is a bit of a mess. The main directory is not under source control. But there is a `tools/phage_i_expanded/repo` folder which is the whole repo but still points to `https://github.com/dmacmillan/PHAGE-I-expanded.git` (now deleted). I suggest we remove `tools/phage_i_expanded/repo` and set page to track the copy hosted at [`cfe-lab/PHAGE-I-expanded`].

# HLA Class
This tool is not part of the Django framework, as it's written in Ruby and PHP and wasn't ported. It is aliased in the Apache config file (`httpd/conf/httpd.conf (385-392)`). Porting to Python seems possible but non-trivial -- `hla-easy.rb` is 500+ lines and relies on at least one method from BioRuby (`Bio::FlatFile.auto`)
